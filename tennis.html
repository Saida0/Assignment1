        <p>Tennis has a long Olympic history but withdrew from the programme after 1924. It did not 
            return as a medal sport until 1988. Professionals are now welcome to compete, and the Olympic 
            competition includes men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles.</p>
